# for the multivariate regressions, I am going to start with a correlation
# between the predictors to get some idea of what can probably be left out.
# Then, I will run a  stepwise regression which will help me finalized what
# predictors I will keep in the final regression. I am then going to run a
# regression with those predictors I deem useful. ANOVA and Sumary output will
# provide information about how well each regression did. A cross-validation
# will be run to see how the model performs in predicting the ranking index and
# determine its bias in predictions. Finally, calculating the RMSE will provide
# the final bit of information needed to determine which model performs best
