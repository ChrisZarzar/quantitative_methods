# ithaca_hi has a very small IQR and therefore it is expected that there will be outliers. It 
# turns out that this is the case when looking at the boxplot. You can expect to have relatively 
# similar mean and median.
# ithaca_lo has a greater spread in the IQR and therefore there are no outliers. The median is
# shifted very far up so you can expect the median and mean to be pretty far off.
